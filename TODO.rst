Fit and Finish
--------------

* fix page padding on both templates when in smaller modes

* on regular pages, the top nav element is not highlighting for the "About"
  section

* on regular pages, the footer needs to have white text

* on regular pages, the page background seems to be white...

* on about pages, the title is missing a "." after "mindpool"

* "freely" is not a good work to use on a company site ;-) Change the
  "Training" section to use a different, less easily misunderstood word

* update logo on regular pages to link to the home page

* clean up pyflakes and pep8
