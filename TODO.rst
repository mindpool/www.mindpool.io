Fit and Finish
--------------

* fix page padding on both templates when in smaller modes

* on regular pages, the footer needs to have white text

* on regular pages, the page background seems to be white...

* "freely" is not a good work to use on a company site ;-) Change the
  "Training" section to use a different, less easily misunderstood word

* update logo on regular pages to link to the home page

* add google analytics to the base template

* change link in footer for MindPool, Inc. to a better color
