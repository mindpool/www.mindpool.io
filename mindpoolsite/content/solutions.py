Solutions
------------------

We are able to assemble various solutions based on our Client needs built
from Open Source foundations. Our current solutions fall into popular implementations
such as Cloud, Software-Defined-Networking, Big Data as well as building custom solutions
around messaging, distributed systems (web-scale), concurrency and machine learning 
problems for our Clients.

Learn more about the Frameworks, Concurrency, Messaging, Distributed Systems, Big Data,
Cloud, Software-Defined Networking and User Experience expertise by browsing the links.

# Ah, the ever-present buzzword, "cloud." Despite the protest of armies of
# systems engineers, it's a useful term. It certainly saves a lot of time typing!
# In the left menu we've outlined only *some* of the technologies encapsulated in
# the term "cloud", and it's still a lot.

# Here's what cloud means to us in a nutshell: **the systematic engineering of
# networked resources**. That's it. And this is what we bring you.

# Of course, there's a bunch involved in that one phrase. Instead of the usual
# litany of technologies-cum-buzzwords, here's a deeper look that keeps the focus
# on the concepts involved:

# * packaging of software and systems such that it's installable by one or more
#   configuration management systems

# * deployment of said resources

# * maintenance and optimization of said resources

# * engineering repeatable, re-deployable customizations (e.g., integration,
#   bespoke components, etc.)

# In the subsequent pages of this section, we give examples of the expertise we
# have and how you can leverage this.
