[DRAFT]

We're not a shop for bodies. We don't provide fleets of robots for use in
assembly-line software dev sweatshops. We are a close-knit team of software and
systems engineers that love working with each other, love tackling hard
problems, and most of all, with ha passion for delivering world-class
integration.

Our teams nurture technical excellence in each engineer. As such, you know
you're getting dedication when you bring us on board. Furthermore, we thrive on
our close connections with each other and with the teams that we join for the
duration of our contracts.

When you hire our services, you are getting engineers that know how to
communicate, know how to engage, know the meaning of strong community
relationships, and how to bring all this -- combined with technical excellence
-- to bear on providing exactly the solution you need.
