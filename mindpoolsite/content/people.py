Teams
-----

[DRAFT]

We're not a shop for bodies. We don't provide fleets of robots for use in
assembly lines software development. We are a close-knit team of software and
systems engineers that love working with each other, love tackling hard
problems, and most of all, love delivering world-class integration.

Our teams nurture not only technical excellence, but also close connections
between all individuals working together, and by estension, everyone in our
company and our contacts with you.

When you contract for our services, you are getting engineers that know how to
communicate, know how to engage, know the meaning of strong community
relationships, and how to bring all this -- combined with their technical
excellence -- to bear on providing exactly the solution you need.
