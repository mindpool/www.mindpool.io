We're not a shop for bodies. We don't provide fleets of drone workers for use
in assembly-line software dev sweatshops. We are a close-knit team of software
and systems engineers that love working with each other, love tackling hard
problems, and most of all, have a passion for delivering world-class solutions.

Our teams nurture technical excellence in each member of the team. As such, you
know you're getting dedication when you bring us on board. Furthermore, we
thrive on our close connections with each other and with the teams that we join
for the duration of our contracts. This keeps project momentum strong, even
during crunch times.

When you hire our services, you are getting engineers that know how to
communicate, know how to engage, know the meaning of strong community
relationships, and how to bring all this -- combined with our technical
excellence -- to bear on providing exactly the solution you need.
