People
------

MindPool is a people company. Through best practices in engineering and
management, we continually focus our attention on what is best for our people.
This keeps the company fresh and our staff highly motivated; and this is what
you get from us.

We're not a shop for bodies. We don't provide fleets of drone workers for use
in assembly-line software dev sweatshops.

We are a close-knit team of software and systems engineers covering three
decades of industry experience who love working with each other, love tackling
hard problems, and most of all, have a passion for delivering world-class
solutions.

Teams
-----

Our teams nurture technical excellence in each member of the team. As such, you
know you're getting dedication when you bring us on board. Furthermore, we
thrive on our close connections with each other and with the teams that we join
for the duration of our engagements. This keeps project momentum strong, even
during crunch times.

When you hire our services, you are getting engineers that know how to
communicate, know how to engage, know the meaning of strong community
relationships, and how to bring all this -- combined with our technical
excellence -- to bear on providing exactly the solution you need.
