Open Source
-----------

The members of MindPool have been users of open source software since the
mid-80s, before the term was even used. By the mid-90s, many of us were deeply
involved with Linux. As the number of machines on the Web increased and online
communications became more prevalent, open source projects begun to emerge from
shared need. We were there. This is where we have been, ever since.

Open source ideologies are at the core of our business. We build what you need.
We train your staff so that the knowledge becomes a part of your organization.
One day at a time, the world becomes a more technically knowledgeable place.

All the code that we work on is available on github. These are our `sponsored
projects`_. Feel free to use what we have created, or base your next project on
one of ours.
