Cloud Technologies
------------------

Ah, the ever-present buzzword, "cloud." Despite the protest of armies of
systems engineers, it's a useful term. It certainly saves a lot of time typing!
In the left menu we've outlined only *some* of the technologies encapsulated in
the term "cloud", and it's still a lot.

Here's what cloud means to us in a nutshell: **the systematic engineering of
networked resources**. That's it. And this is what we bring you.

Of course, there's a bunch involved in that one phrase. Instead of the usual
litany of technologies-cum-buzzwords, here's a deeper look that keeps the focus
on the concepts involved:

* packaging of software and systems such that it's installable by one or more
  configuration management systems

* deployment of said resources

* maintenance and optimization of said resources

* engineering repeatable, re-deployable customizations (e.g., integration,
  bespoke components, etc.)

In the subsequent pages of this section, we give examples of the expertise we
have and how you can leverage this.
