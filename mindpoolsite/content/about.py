Who We Are
----------

    "Henceforth, we're all to be known as Team Alpha Super Awesome Cool
    Dynamite Wolf Squadron."


What we are:

* We're a *services* company exploring new frontiers in global software
  engineering.

* We're seasoned entrepreneurs with many start-ups under our collective belt,
  but who wanted to work on fresh ideas at a bigger scale.

* We are engineers who share a vision of the future, one where MindPool is the
  first logical step toward our goals.

* We are altruists who actively pursue projects that are focused on improving
  our world, now.

* We're green. Super-green.


What we're not:

* We're not looking for exit strategies.

* We're not in business to stroke our egos, get famous, or make one beeellion
  dollars.

* We're not another group of engineers that's "gone independent".

What We Do
----------

We have placed our collective technical expertise at the disposal of
organizations that are interested in engaging with dynamic, creative thinkers
to solve difficult technical problems. This, in a nutshell, is what we do.

Here's another view: we bring up clouds, integreate with existing, systems, put
web services and enterprise messaging in place, create bespoke software meeting
your exact needs, manager projects, provide coaching for becoming contributing
members of various open source communities, and offer a wide range of technical
training.

The tools that we use and the knowledge that we have are diplayed in other
pages on the site, on our blog, or in our code repositories. But what you won't
find there is that our skills and experience is not *all* you get. We bring our
founding vision, our work ethic, our natural camaraderie, and our company
culture to every project.
