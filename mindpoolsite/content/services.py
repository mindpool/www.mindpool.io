Training
--------

Education is a passion we share at MindPool. This is equal only to our passion
for contributing to an improved world through better integrations of new
technologies and the systems that they support.

When we hand off a completed project to you, we want you to be thoroughly
delighted. Sometimes this means ensuring that your team knows how to maintain
what we've delivered, or empowering them add new features over time.

Some organizations have contacted us simply for our decades of experience. As
they were building out their own teams, we provided instruction and training on
their chosen technologies and how they could integrate with the appropriate
open source communities.

In short, we can provide the desired training your teams may need.
