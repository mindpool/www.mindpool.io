Technologies
------------

We assemble our solutions -- built from open source foundations -- based on
customers' needs.  These currently fall into categories commonly referred to as
*Cloud*, *Software Defined Networking*, and *Big Data*. Additionally, we
provide custom applications and system integration around enterprise messaging,
distributed ("web scale") systems, diverse concurrency requirements, and the
field of machine learning.

We provide systematic, repeatable engineering of these technologies. After the
development cycle, we assist with packaging, installation, configuration,
deployment, maintenance and training -- all on an as-needed basis.

# from duncan: I commented out the following chunk, since it duplicates some of
# what's listed in the menus, and requires maintenance every time we change the

# from murali: commented out
# Ah, the ever-present buzzword, "cloud." Despite the protest of armies of
# systems engineers, it's a useful term. It certainly saves a lot of time typing!
# In the left menu we've outlined only *some* of the technologies encapsulated in
# the term "cloud", and it's still a lot.

# Here's what cloud means to us in a nutshell: **the systematic engineering of
# networked resources**. That's it. And this is what we bring you.

# Of course, there's a bunch involved in that one phrase. Instead of the usual
# litany of technologies-cum-buzzwords, here's a deeper look that keeps the focus
# on the concepts involved:

# * packaging of software and systems such that it's installable by one or more
#   configuration management systems

# * deployment of said resources

# * maintenance and optimization of said resources

# * engineering repeatable, re-deployable customizations (e.g., integration,
#   bespoke components, etc.)

# In the subsequent pages of this section, we give examples of the expertise we
# have and how you can leverage this.

Programming Languages are the Foundation
----------------------------------------

We build upon the fundamental building blocks - Open Source Programming languages. 

In our digital age, it is programming languages that form the basis of much of
our modern lives. It is with the languages that everything starts, closely
followed by libraries and then `frameworks`_.

By choosing intelligently the most effective tools for the job, the end product
is more stable, more flexible, more robust, and delivered more quickly.
Languages and their libraries (and, of course, the frameworks that build upon
these) are what decide that for software engineering.

*Below is a selection of language that we are currently supporting:*
